### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis (Focus on 3 cities in the United States)

### Description
This project explores the usage patterns of bike-sharing systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. Using data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider, this analysis uncovers insights into popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics. By computing various descriptive statistics, the project provides a comprehensive overview of how bike-sharing systems are utilized in these cities.

### Common Usage Information
This project is commonly used to:
- Identify trends in bike usage to improve bike-sharing system efficiency.
- Provide insights to urban planners for infrastructure development.
- Analyze user demographics to tailor services.
- Educate on data analysis and Python programming skills.
